= What next?

This book covers the key things you need to know to start creating
GUI applications with Python. If you've made it here you should be
well on your way to create your own apps!

But there is still a to discover while you build your applications.
To help with this I post regular tips, tutorials and code snippets
https://martinfitzpatrick.name/tag/gui/[on my website]. Like this book
all samples are MIT licensed and free to mix into your own apps.

If you've received this book from someone else, you may also
be interested in my https://martinfitzpatrick.name/create-simple-gui-applications[related video course]
which allows you to follow through and see the development of PyQt
applications live.

Thanks for reading, and if you have any feedback or suggestions for for
additional topics to cover please let me know.

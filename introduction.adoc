Welcome to *Creating Simple GUI Applications* where we will discover how
to use Python and Qt to do just that.

If you want to learn how to write GUI applications with Python it
can be tricky to get started. There are a lot of new concepts
you need to understand to get _anything_ to work. But, like any code,
writing GUI applications requires you to learn to think about the problem
in the right way.

In this book I will give you everything that you need to start
building functional applications with the PyQt framework. In no time at all you will have
a fully functional Qt application - ready to customise as you like.

If you bought this book you will have received a full copy of the source code and resources
with it. But don't just copy and paste and move on â€” you will learn much more if you
experiment along the way! All the code is MIT licensed, meaning you are free to mix and
match into your own projects.


== Book format

This book is formatted as a series of coding exercises and snippets to allow you 
to gradually explore and learn the details of PyQt5. However, it is not possible to give 
you a _complete_ overview of the Qt system in a book of this size.

If you find yourself thinking "I wonder if I can do _that_" the best thing you
can do is put this book down, then _go and find out!_ Just keep regular backups of your 
code along the way so you always have something to come back to if you royally mess it up.

[TIP]
====
Throughout this books there are also boxes like this, giving info, tips and warnings.
All of them can be safely skipped over if you are in a hurry, but reading them will
give you a deeper and more rounded knowledge of the Qt framework.

== Qt and PyQt

When you write applications using PyQt what you area _really_ doing is writing
applications in Qt. The PyQt library is simply.footnote:[Not really _that_ simple.]
a wrapper around the C++ Qt library, to allow it to be used in Python.

Because this is a Python interface to a C++ library the naming conventions used 
within PyQt do not adhere to PEP8 standards. Most notably functions and variables
are named using `mixedCase` rather than `snake_case`. Whether you adhere to this
standard in your own applications based on PyQt is entirely up to you, however
I find it to follow Python standards for my own code, to help clarify where the
PyQt code ends and your own begins.

Further, while there is PyQt specific documentation available, you will often find 
yourself reading the Qt documentation itself as it is more complete. If you do
you will need to translate object syntax and some methods containining Python-reserved function names as follows:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|=== 
| Qt
| PyQt

| `Qt::SomeValue`
| `Qt.SomeValue`

| `object.exec()`
| `object.exec_()`  

| `object.print()`
| `object.print_()` 
|=== 

The books is written and updated to work with the current latest version of
Qt (and PyQt). As of writing this is Qt 5.10. However, many of the examples
will work fine with earlier versions of Qt. If you are still using PyQt 4
you will need to change the imports.

== Python 3

This book is written to be compatible with Python 3.4+. Python 3 is
the future of the language, and if you're starting out now is where you should
be focusing your efforts. However, in recognition of the fact that many 
people are stuck supporting or developing on legacy systems, the examples and 
code used in this book are also tested and confirmed to work on Python 2.7. Any notable 
incompatiblities or gotchas will be flagged with a meh-face to accurately 
portray the sentiment e.g.


====
icon:meh-o[] In Python 2.7 `map()` returns a `list`.

If you are using Python 3 you can safely ignore their indifferent gaze.

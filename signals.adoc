== Signals

As already described, every interaction the user has with a Qt application causes
an Event. There are multiple types of event, each representing a difference
type of interaction — e.g. mouse or keyboard events.

Events that occur are passed to the event-specific handler on the widget where
the interaction occurred. For example, clicking on a widget will cause a
`QMouseEvent` to be sent to the `.mousePressEvent` event handler on the widget.
This handler can interrogate the event to find out information, such as
what triggered the event and where specifically it occurred.

You can intercept events by subclassing and overriding the handler function on
the class, as you would for any other function. You can choose to filter,
modify, or ignore events, passing them through to the normal handler for
the event by calling the parent class function with `super()`.

[source,python]
----
class CustomButton(Qbutton)

    def keyPressEvent(self, e):
        # My custom event handling
        super(CustomButton, self).keyPressEvent(e)
----

However, imagine you want to catch an event on 20 different buttons. Subclassing
like this now becomes an incredibly tedious way of catching, interpreting
and handling these events.

[source,python]
----
class CustomButton99(Qbutton)

    def keyPressEvent(self, e):
        # My custom event handling
        super(CustomButton99, self).keyPressEvent(e)
----

Instead of intercepting raw events, Qt provides
_Signals_ which allow you to 'listen' for
notifications of specific occurrences within your application. While
these can be similar to events — a click on a button — they can also
be more nuanced — updated text in a box. Data can also be sent
alongside a signal - so as well as being notified of the updated text
you can also receive it.

The receivers of signals are called *Slots* in Qt terminology. A number of
standard slots are provided on Qt classes to allow you to wire together
different parts of your application. However, you can also use any Python
function as a slot, and therefore receive the message yourself.


TIP: Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_window.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

=== QMainWindow Signals

For example, let's look at the signals available for our `QMainWindow`. You can
find this information in the http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmainwindow.html[Qt documentation].
Scroll down to the Signals section to see the signals implemented for
this class.

As you can see, alongside the two `QMainWindow` signals, there are
4 signals inherited from `QWidget` and 2 signals inherited from `Object`.
If you click through to the `QWidget` signal documentation you can see a
`.windowTitleChanged` signal implemented here. Next we'll demonstrate that
signal within our application.

We start by creating an function that will behave as a ‘slot’ for our
signals.

Then we use .connect on the `.windowTitleChanged` signal. We pass the
function that we want to be called with the signal data. In this case
the signal sends a string, containing the new window title.

If we run that, we see that we receive the notification that the window
title has changed.

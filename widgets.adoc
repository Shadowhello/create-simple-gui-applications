== Widgets

In Qt (and most User Interfaces) ‘widget’ is the name given to a
component of the UI that the user can interact with. User interfaces are
made up of multiple widgets, arranged within the window.

Qt comes with a large selection of widgets available, and even allows
you to create your own custom and customised widgets.

TIP: Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_window.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

=== Big ol' list of widgets

A full list of widgets is available on the Qt documentation. But lets
have a look at them quickly.

<<<

[source,python]

include::code/widgets_list.py[]

<<<

To do this we’re going to take the skeleton of our application and
replace the `QLabel` with a `QWidget`. This is the generic form of a Qt
widget.

Here we’re not using it directly. We apply a list of widgets - in a
layout, which we will cover shortly - and then add the `QWidget` as the
central widget for the window. The result is that we fill the window
with widgets, with the `QWidget` acting as a container.

[TIP]
.Compound widgets
====
Note that it’s possible to use this `QWidget` layout trick to create
custom compound widgets. For example you can take a base `QWidget` and
overlay a layout containing multiple widgets of different types. This
'widget' can then be inserted into other layouts as normal. We'll
cover custom widgets in more detail later.
====

Lets have a look at all the example widgets, from top to bottom:

[options="header"]
|====
| Widget            | What it does
| `QCheckbox`       | A checkbox
| `QComboBox`       | A dropdown list box
| `QDateEdit`       | For editing dates and datetimes
| `QDateTimeEdit`   | For editing dates and datetimes
| `QDial`           | Rotateable dial
| `QDoubleSpinbox`  | A number spinner for floats
| `QFontComboBox`   | A list of fonts
| `QLCDNumber`      | A quite ugly LCD display
| `QLabel`          | Just a label, not interactive
| `QLineEdit`       | Enter a line of text
| `QProgressBar`    | A progress bar
| `QPushButton`     | A button
| `QRadioButton`    | A toggle set, with only one active item
| `QSlider`         | A slider
| `QSpinBox`        | An integer spinner
| `QTimeEdit`       | For editing times
|====

There are actually more widgets than this, but they don’t fit so well!
You can see them all by checking the documentation. Here we’re going to
take a closer look at the a subset of the most useful.

<<<

==== QLabel

We'll start the tour with `QLabel`, arguably one of the simplest widgets
available in the Qt toolbox. This is a simple one-line piece of text
that you can position in your application. You can set the text by
passing in a str as you create it:

[source,python]
----
widget = QLabel("Hello")
----

Or, by using the `.setText()` method:

[source,python]
----
widget = QLabel("1") # The label is created with the text 1
widget.setText("2")  # The label now shows 2
----

You can also adjust font parameters, such as the size of the font or
the alignment of text in the widget.

[source,python]
----
include::code/widgets_1.py[]
----


[TIP]
.Font tips
====
Note that if you want to change the properties of a widget font it
is usually better to get the *current* font, update it and then
apply it back. This ensures the font face remains in keeping with
the desktop conventions.
====

The alignment is specified by using a flag from the `Qt.` namespace.
The flags available for horizontal alignment are:

[options="header"]
|====
| Flag              | Behaviour                                     |
| `Qt.AlignLeft`    | Aligns with the left edge.                    |
| `Qt.AlignRight`   | Aligns with the right edge.                   |
| `Qt.AlignHCenter` | Centers horizontally in the available space.  |
| `Qt.AlignJustify` | Justifies the text in the available space.    |
|====

The flags available for vertical alignment are:

[options="header"]
|====
| Flag              | Behaviour                                     |
| `Qt.AlignTop`     | Aligns with the top.                          |
| `Qt.AlignBottom`  | Aligns with the bottom.                       |
| `Qt.AlignVCenter` | Centers vertically in the available space.    |
|====

You can combine flags together using pipes (`|`), however note that you
can only use vertical or horizontal alignment flag at a time.

[source,python]
----
align_top_left = Qt.AlignLeft | Qt.AlignTop
----

[TIP]
.Qt Flags
====
Note that you use an *OR* pipe (`|`) to combine the two flags (not `A & B`).
This is because the flags are non-overlapping bitmasks.
e.g. `Qt.AlignLeft` has the hexadecimal value `0x0001`,
while `Qt.AlignBottom` is `0x0040`.
By ORing together we get the value `0x0041` representing 'bottom left'.
This principle applies to all other combinatorial Qt flags.

If this is gibberish to you, feel free to ignore and move on.
====


Finally, there is also a shorthand flag that centers in both directions simultaneously:

[options="header"]
|====
| Flag              | Behaviour                                       |
| `Qt.AlignCenter`  | Centers horizontally *and* vertically           |
|====

Weirdly, you can also use `QLabel` to display an image using `.setPixmap()`.
This accepts an *pixmap*, which you can create by passing an image filename
to `QPixmap`. In the example files provided with this book you can find
a file `otje.jpg` which you can display in your window as follows:

[source,python]
----
widget.setPixMap(QPixmap('otje.jpg'))
----

<<<

.Otgon "Otje" Ginge
image::otje.jpg[scaledwidth=50%,align="center"]

What a lovely face. By default the image scales while maintaining its
aspect ratio. If you want it to stretch and scale to fit the window completely
you can set `.setScaledContents(True)` on the `QLabel`.

[source,python]
----
widget.setScaledContents(True)
----

For example,

[source,python]
----
include::code/widgets_2.py[]
----

<<<

==== QCheckBox

The next widget to look at is `QCheckBox()` which, as the name suggests, presents a
checkable box to the user. However, as with all Qt widgets there are number of
configurable options to change the widget behaviours.

[source,python]
----
include::code/widgets_3.py[]
----


You can set a checkbox state programmatically using `.setChecked` or `.setCheckState`.
The former accepts either `True` or `False` representing checked or unchecked respectively.
However, with `.setCheckState` you also specify a particially checked state using a
`Qt.` namespace flag:

[options="header"]
|===
| Flag                  | Behaviour
| `Qt.Unchecked`        | Item is unchecked
| `Qt.PartiallyChecked` | Item is partially checked
| `Qt.Checked`          | Item is unchecked
|===

A checkbox that supports a partially-checked (`Qt.PartiallyChecked`) state is
commonly referred to as 'tri-state', that is being neither on nor off. A checkbox
in this state is commonly shown as a greyed out checkbox, and is commonly used in
hierachical checkbox arrangements where sub-items are linked to parent checkboxes.

If you set the value to `Qt.PartiallyChecked` the checkbox will become
tristate. You can also `.setTriState(True)` to set tristate support on a
You can also set a checkbox to be tri-state without setting the current state to
partially checked by using `.setTriState(True)`

[TIP]
====
You may notice that when the script is running the current state number is displayed
as an `int` with checked = `2`, unchecked = `0`, and partially
checked = `1`. You don’t need to remember these values, the `Qt.Checked` namespace
variable `== 2` for example. This is the value of these state's respective flags.
This means you can test state using `state == Qt.Checked`.

==== QComboBox

The `QComboBox` is a drop down list, closed by default with an arrow to open it.
You can select a single item from the list, with the currently selected item being
shown as a label on the widget. The combo box is suited to selection of a choice
from a long list of options.

I> You have probably seen the combo box used for selection of
I> font faces, or size, in word processing applications. Although Qt actually provides
I> a specific font-selection combo box as `QFontComboBox`.

You can add items to a `QComboBox` by passing a list of strings to `.addItems()`.
Items will be added in the order they are provided.

[source,python]
----
include::code/widgets_4.py[]
----


The `.currentIndexChanged` signal is triggered when the currently selected item
is updated, by default passing the index of the selected item in the list.
However, when connecting to the signal you can also request an alternative version
of the signal by appending `[str]` (think of the signal as a `dict`). This alternative
interface instead provides the label of the currently selected item, which is often
more useful.

`QComboBox` can also be editable, allowing users to enter values not currently in the list
and either have them inserted, or simply used as a value. To make the box editable:

[source,python]
----
widget.setEditable(True)
----

You can also set a flag to determine how the insert is handled. These flags are stored
on the `QComboBox` class itself and are listed below:

[options="header"]
|===
| Flag                              | Behaviour
| `QComboBox.NoInsert`              | No insert
| `QComboBox.InsertAtTop`           | Insert as first item
| `QComboBox.InsertAtCurrent`       | Replace currently selected item
| `QComboBox.InsertAtBottom`        | Insert after last item
| `QComboBox.InsertAfterCurrent`    | Insert after current item
| `QComboBox.InsertBeforeCurrent`   | Insert before current item
| `QComboBox.InsertAlphabetically`  | Insert in alphabetical order
|===


To use these, apply the flag as follows:

[source,python]
----
widget.setInsertPolicy(QComboBox.InsertAlphabetically)
----

You can also limit the number of items allowed in the box by using `.setMaxCount`, e.g.

[source,python]
----
widget.setMaxCount(10)
----

<<<

==== QListBox

Next `QListBox`. It’s very similar to `QComboBox`, differing mainly in the
signals available.

[source,python]
----
include::code/widgets_5.py[]
----

`QListBox` offers an `currentItemChanged` signal which sends the `QListItem`
(the element of the list box), and a `currentTextChanged` signal which
sends the text.

<<<

==== QLineEdit

The `QLineEdit` widget is a simple single-line text editing box, into
which users can type input. These are used for form fields, or settings
where there is no restricted list of valid inputs. For example, when
entering an email address, or computer name.

[source,python]
----
include::code/widgets_6.py[]
----


As demonstrated in the above code, you can set a maximum length for the
text field by using `.setMaxLength`. Placeholder text, which is text shown
until something is entered by the user can be added using `.setPlaceholderText`.

The `QLineEdit` has a number of signals available for different editing
events including when return is pressed (by the user), when the user selection
is changed. There are also two edit signals, one for when the text in the box
has been edited and one for when it has been changed. The distinction here is
between user edits and programmatic changes. The `textEdited` signal is only
sent when the user edits text.

Additionally, it is possible to perform input validation using an *input mask*
to define which characters are supported and where. This can be applied
to the field as follows:

[source,python]
----
widget.setInputMask('000.000.000.000;_')
----

The above would allow a series of 3-digit numbers separated with periods, and
could therefore be used to validate IPv4 addresses.

<<<

==== QSpinBox and QDoubleSpinBox

`QSpinBox` provides a small numerical input box with arrows to increase
and decrease the value. `QSpinBox` supports integers while the related widget
`QDoubleSpinBox` supports floats.

[source,python]
----
include::code/widgets_7.py[]
----

The demonstration code above shows the various features that are available
for the widget.

To set the range of acceptable values you can use `setMinimum` and `setMaximum`,
or alternatively use `setRange` to set both simultaneously. Annotation of value
types is supported with both prefixes and suffixes that can be added to the number,
e.g. for currency markers or units using `.setPrefix` and `.setSuffix` respectively.

Clicking on the up and down arrows on the widget will increase or decrease the
value in the widget by an amount, which can be set using `.setSingleStep`. Note
that this has no effect on the values that are acceptable to the widget.

Both `QSpinBox` and `QDoubleSpinBox` have a `.valueChanged` signal which
fires whenever their value is altered. The raw `.valueChanged` signal
sends the numeric value (either an `int` or a `float`) while the `str`
alternate signal, accessible via `.valueChanged[str]` sends the value as a
string, including both the prefix and suffix characters.

<<<

==== QSlider

`QSlider` provides a slide-bar widget, which functions internally much
like a `QDoubleSpinBox`. Rather than display the current value numerically,
it is represented by the position of the slider
handle along the length of the widget. This is often useful when providing
adjustment between two extremes, but where absolutel accuracy is not required.
The most common use of this type of widget is for volume controls.

There is an additional `.sliderMoved` signal that is triggered whenever the
slider moves position and a `.sliderPressed` signal that emits whenever the
slider is clicked.

[source,python]
----
include::code/widgets_8.py[]
----


You can also construct a slider with a vertical or horizontal orientation by
passing the orientation in as you create it. The orientiation flags are
defined in the `Qt.` namespace. For example:

[source,python]
----
widget.QSlider(Qt.Vertical)
----

Or:

[source,python]
----
widget.QSlider(Qt.Horizontal)
----

<<<

==== QDial

Finally, the `QDial` is a rotateable widget that functions just like the
slider, but appears as an analogue dial. This looks nice, but from a UI
perspective is not particularly userfriendly. However, they are often
used in audio applications as representation of real-world analogue dials.

[source,python]
----
include::code/widgets_9.py[]
----

The signals are the same as for `QSlider` and retain the same names
(e.g. `.sliderMoved`).

This concludes our brief tour through the Qt widgets available in
PyQt. To see the full http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/[list of available widgets, including all their signals and
attributes, take a look at the [Qt documentation].

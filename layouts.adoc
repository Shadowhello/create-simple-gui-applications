== Layouts

So far we've successfully created a window, and we've added a widget to it. However
we normally want to add more than one widget to a window, and have some control over
where it ends up. To do this in Qt we use *layouts*. There are 4 basic layouts
available in Qt, which are listed in the following table.

[options="header"]
|===
| Layout                            | Behaviour
| `QHBoxLayout`                     | Linear horizontal layout
| `QVBoxLayout`                     | Linear vertical layout
| `QGridLayout`                     | In indexable grid XxY
| `QStackedLayout`                  | Stacked (z) in front of one another

[TIP]
.Qt Designer
====
You can actually design and lay out your interface graphically using the Qt
designer, which we will cover later. Here we're using code, as it's simpler
to understand and experiment with the underlying system.
====

As you can see, there are three positional layouts available in Qt. The `VBoxLayout`,
`QHBoxLayout` and `QGridLayout`. In addition there is also `QStackedLayout` which
allows you to place widgets one on top of the other within the same space, yet
showing only one layout at a time.

TIP: Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_window.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

Before we start experimenting with the different layouts, we're first going to
create a very simple custom widget that we can use to visualise the layouts
that we use. Add the following code to your file as a new class at the top level:

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_colorwidget.py[]
----

In this code we subclass `QWdiget` to create our own custom widget `Color`. We accept a
single parameter when creating the widget — `color` (a `str`). We first set
`.setAutoFillBackground` to `True` to tell the widget to automatically fill it's background
with the window color. Next we get the current palette (which is the global desktop palette
by default) and change the current `QPalette.Window` color to a new `QColor` described
by the value `color` we passed in. Finally we apply this palette back to the widget. The
end result is a widget that is filled with a solid color, that we specified when we
created it.

If you find the above confusing, don't worry too much. We'll cover custom widgets in
more detail later. For now it's sufficient that you understand that calling you
can create a solid-filled red widget by doing the following:

[source,python]
----
Color('red')
----

First let's test our new `Color` widget by using it to fill the entire window in a
single color. Once it’s complete we can add it to the mainwindow using `.setCentralWidget`
and we get a solid red window.

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_1.py[]
----

====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!* The window will appear, filled completely with the color red. +
Notice how the widget expands to fill all the available space.
====

Next we'll look at each of the available Qt layouts in turn. Note
that to add our layouts to the window we will need a dummy
`QWidget` to hold the layout.

=== `QVBoxLayout` vertically arranged widgets

With `QVBoxLayout` you arrange widgets one above the other linearly.
Adding a widget adds it to the bottom of the column.

.A QVBoxLayout, filled from top to bottom.

Lets add our widget to a layout. Note that in order to add a layout to the
`QMainWindow` we need to apply it to a dummy `QWidget`. This allows us to then
use `.setCentralWidget` to apply the widget (and the layout) to the window.
Our coloured widgets will arrange themselves in the layout,
contained within the `QWidget` in the window. First we just add the red widget
as before.

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_2a.py[]
----

====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!* Notice the border now visible around the red widget. +
This is the layout spacing — we'll see how to adjust that later.
====

Next add a few more coloured widgets to the layout:

As we add widgets they line themselves up vertically in the order they
are added.

=== `QHBoxLayout` horizontally arranged widgets

`QHBoxLayout` is the same, except moving horizontally. Adding a widget
adds it to the right hand side.

.A QHBoxLayout, filled from left to right.
image::hboxlayout.png[scaledwidth=50%,align="center"]

To use it we can simply change the `QVBoxLayout` to a `QHBoxLayout`.
The boxes now flow left to right.

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_3.py[]
----

=== Nesting layouts

For more complex layouts you can nest layouts inside one another using
.addLayout` on a layout. Below we add a `QVBoxLayout` into the main `QHBoxLayout`.
If we add some widgets to the `QVBoxLayout`, they’ll be arranged vertically in the first slot of the
parent layout.

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_4.py[]
----

====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!* The widgets should arrange themselves in 3 columns horizontally, with the
first column also containing 3 widgets stacked vertically. Experiment!
====

You can set the spacing around the layout using `.setContentMargins` or set the spacing between elements using `.setSpacing`.

[source,python]
----
layout1.setContentsMargins(0,0,0,0)
layout1.setSpacing(20)
----

The following code shows the combination of nested widgets and layout margins
and spacing. Experiment with the numbers til you get a feel for them.

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_5.py[]

=== `QGridLayout` widgets arranged in a grid

As useful as they are, if you try and using `QVBoxLayout` and `QHBoxLayout` for
laying out multiple elements, e.g. for a form, you’ll find it very
difficult to ensure differently sized widgets line up. The solution to
this is `QGridLayout`.

.A QGridLayout showing the grid positions for each location.
image::gridlayout1.png[scaledwidth=50%,align="center"]

`QGridLayout` allows you to position items specifically in a grid. You
specify row and column positions for each widget. You can skip elements,
and they will be left empty.

Usefully, for `QGridLayout` you don't need to fill all the positions in the grid.

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_6.py[]
----

=== `QStackedLayout` multiple widgets in the same space

The final layout we’ll cover is the `QStackedLayout`. As described, this
layout allows you to position elements directly in front of one another.
You can then select which widget you want to show.
You could use this for drawing layers in a graphics application,
or for imitating a tab-like interface. Note there is also `QStackedWidget`
which is a container widget that works in exactly the same way. This is
useful if you want to add a stack directly to a `QMainWindow` with
`.setCentralWidget`.

.QStackedLayout — in use only the uppermost widget is visible, which is by default the first widget added to the layout.
image::qstackedlayout1.png[scaledwidth=50%,align="center"]

image::qstackedlayout2.png[scaledwidth=50%,align="center"]

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_7.py[]
----

`QStackedWidget` is exactly how tabbed views in applications work. Only one view
('tab') is visible at any one time. You can control which widget to show at
any time by using `.setCurrentIndex()` or `.setCurrentWidget()` to set the item
by either the index (in order the widgets were added) or by the widget itself.

Below is a short demo using `QStackedLayout` in combination with `QButton` to
to provide a tab-like interface to an application:

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_8.py[]
----

Helpfully. Qt actually provide a built-in TabWidget that provides
this kind of layout out of the box - albeit in widget form.
Below the tab demo is recreated using `QTabWidget`:

[source,python]
----
include::code/layout_9.py[]
----

As you can see, it's a little more straightforward — and a bit more attractive!
You can set the position of the tabs using the cardinal directions, toggle
whether tabs are moveable with `.setMoveable` and turn a 'document mode' on
and off which (on OS X) shows a slimmer tab interface. We encounter more of these
advanced widgets later.

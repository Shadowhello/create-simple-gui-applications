= The complete book

If you enjoyed this sample you can purchase the complete book, together
with a optional video course, at https://martinfitzpatrick.name/create-simple-gui-applications

The full book covers many more aspects of developing with PyQt, from
getting started with the Qt Creator to multithreading advanced
applications. All purchases come with free updates as the book is
developed and expands.

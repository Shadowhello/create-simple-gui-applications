== Actions (Toolbars and Menus)

Next we'll look at some of the common user interface elements, that you've probably seen
in many other applications — toolbars and menus. We'll also explore the neat system
Qt provides for minimising the duplication between different UI areas — `QAction`.

=== Toolbars

One of the most commonly seen user interface elements is the toolbar.Toolbars are bars of icons and/or text used to perform common tasks within an
application, for which accessing via a menu would be cumbersome.
They are one of the most common UI features seen in many applications. While
some complex applications, particularly in the Microsoft Office suite, have
migrated to contextual 'ribbon' interfaces, the standard toolbar is usually
sufficient for the majority of applications you will create.

.Standard GUI elements - The toolbar
image::toolbar.png[align="center"]

Qt toolbars support display of icons, text, and can also contain any standard
Qt widget. However, for buttons the best approach is to make use of the
QAction system to place buttons on the toolbar.

Let's start by adding a toolbar to our application.

TIP: Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_window.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

In Qt toolbars are created from the QToolBar class. To start you create an instance of the class
and then call `.addToolbar` on the QMainWindow. Passing a string in as the first
parameter to `QToolBar` sets the toolbar's name, which will be used to identify the toolbar
in the UI.

====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!* You'll see a thin grey bar at the top of the window. This is your toolbar. Right click
and click the name to toggle it off.
====

[WARNING]
.I can't get my toolbar back!?
====
Unfortunately once you remove a toolbar there is now no place to right click to re-add
it. So as a general rule you want to either keep one toolbar unremoveable, or provide
an alternative interface to turn toolbars on and off.
====

Lets make the toolbar a bit more interesting. We could just add a `QButton` widget, but there
is a better approach in Qt that gets you some cool features — and that is via `QAction`.
`QAction` is a class that provides a way to describe abstract user interfaces. What this means
in English, is that you can define multiple interface elements within a single object, unified
by the effect that interacting with that element has. For example, it is common to have functions
that are represented in the toolbar but also the menu — think of something like Edit->Cut
which is present both in the Edit menu but also on the toolbar as a pair of scissors, and
also through the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-X` (`Cmd-X` on Mac).

Without `QAction` you would have to define this in multiple places. But with `QAction` you can
define a single `QAction`, defining the triggered action, and then add this action to both the
menu and the toolbar. Each `QAction` has names, status messages, icons and signals that you \
can connect to (and much more).

So lets add our first `QAction`.

[source,python]
----
include::code/toolbars_and_menus_2.py[]
----

To start with we create the function that will accept the signal from teh QAction so we can
see if it is working.  Next we define the `QAction` itself. When creating the instance we can
pass a label for the action and/or an icon. You must also pass in any `QObject` to act as the
parent for the action — here we're passing `self` as a reference to our main window.
Strangely for QAction the parent element is passed in as the final parameter.


Next, we can opt to set a status tip — this text will be displayed on the status bar
once we have one. Finally we connect the `.triggered` signal to the custom function. This
signal will fire whenever the `QAction` is 'triggered' (or activated).

====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!* You should see your button with the label that you have defined. Click on it and the
our custom function will emit "click" and the status of the button.
====

[TIP]
.Why is the signal always false?
====
The signal passed indicates whether the button is *checked*,
and since our button is not checkable — just clickable — it is always false.
We'll show how to make it checkable shortly.
====

Lets add a statusbar.

We create a status bar object by calling `QStatusBar` and passing the result into `.setStatusBar`. Since we
don't need to change the statusBar settings we can just pass it in as we create it. We can
create and define the statusbar in a single line:

[source,python]
----
include::code/toolbars_and_menus_3.py[]
----

====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!*  Hover your mouse over the toolbar button and you will see the status text in the status bar.
====

Next we're going to turn our QAction toggleable — so clicking will turn it on, clicking again
will turn it off. To do this, we simple call `setCheckable(True)` on the `QAction` object.

[source,python]
----
include::code/toolbars_and_menus_4.py[]
----

====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!* Click on the button to see it toggle from checked to unchecked state. Note that custom slot
function we create now alternates outputting `True` and `False`.
====

[TIP]
.The `.toggled` signal
====
There is also a `.toggled` signal, which only emits a signal when the button
is toggled. But the effect is identical so it is mostly pointless.
====

Things look pretty shabby right now — so let's add an icon to our button. For this I recommend
you download the http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/[fugue icon set] by designer
 http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/[Yusuke Kamiyamane].
It's a great set of beautiful 16x16 icons that can give your apps a nice professional look.
It is freely available with only attribution required when you distribute your application —
although I am sure the designer would appreciate some cash too if you have some spare.

.Fugue Icon Set — Yusuke Kamiyamane
image::fugue-icons.png[align="center"]

Select an image from the set (in the examples here I've selected the file `bug.png`) and copy
it into the same folder as your source code. To add the icon to the `QAction` (and therefore
the button) we simply pass it in as the first parameter when creating the `QAction`. If
the icon is in the same folder as your source code you can just copy it to

You also need to let the toolbar know how large your icons are, otherwise your icon will
be surrounded by a lot of padding. You can do this by calling `.setIconSize()` with a `QSize` object.

[source,python]
----
include::code/toolbars_and_menus_5.py[]
----


====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!*  The QAction is now represented by an icon.  +
Everything should function exactly as it did before.
====

Note that Qt uses your operating system
default settings to determine whether to show an icon, text or an icon and text in the toolbar.
But you can override this by using `.setToolButtonStyle`. This slot accepts any of the
following flags from the `Qt.` namespace:

[options="header"]
|====
| Flag                          | Behaviour
| `Qt.ToolButtonIconOnly`       | Icon only, no text
| `Qt.ToolButtonTextOnly`       | Text only, no icon
| `Qt.ToolButtonTextBesideIcon` | Icon and text, with text beside the icon
| `Qt.ToolButtonTextUnderIcon`  | Icon and text, with text under the icon
| `Qt.ToolButtonIconOnly`       | Icon only, no text
| `Qt.ToolButtonFollowStyle`    | Follow the host desktop style
|====

[TIP]
.Which style should I use?
====
The default value is `Qt.ToolButtonFollowStyle`, meaning that your application
will default to following the standard/global setting for the desktop on
which the application runs. This is generally recommended to make your
application feel as *native* as possible.
====

Finally, lets just add a few more bits and bobs to the toolbar. We'll add a second button
and a checkbox widget. As mentioned you can literally put any widget in here, so
feel free to go crazy. Don't worry about the QCheckBox type, we'll cover that later.

[source,python]

include::code/toolbars_and_menus_6.py[]

====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!*  Now you see multiple buttons and a checkbox.
====

=== Menus

Menus are another standard component of UIS. Typically they are on the top of the window,
or the top of a screen on a Mac. They allow access to all standard application functions.
A few standard menus exist — for example File, Edit, Help.
Menus can be nested to create hierarchical trees of functions and they often support and
display keyboard shortcuts for fast access to their functions.

.Standard GUI elements - Menus
image::menus.png[scaledwidth=25%,align="center"]

To create a menu, we create a menubar we call `.menuBar()` on the QMainWindow.
We add a menu on our menu bar by calling `.addMenu()`, passing in the name of the menu.
I've called it `'&File'`.  The amspersand defines a quick key to jump to this menu when pressing Alt.

[source,python]
----
include::code/toolbars_and_menus_7.py[]
----

[WARNING]
.Quick Keys on Mac
====
This won't be visible on Mac. Note that this is different to a keyboard shortcut — we'll
cover that shortly.
====

Next we add something to menu. This is where the power of QActions comes in to play. We can
reuse the already existing QAction to add the same function to the menu. Click it and you will
notice that it is toggleable — it inherits the features of the QAction.

Lets add some more things to the menu. Here we'll add a separator to the menu, which will
appear as a horizontal line in the menu, and then add the second QAction we created.

[source,python]
----
include::code/toolbars_and_menus_8.py[]
----


====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!* You should see two menu items with a line between them.
====


You can also use ampersand to add accelerator keys to the menu to allow a single key to be used to jump to a
menu item when it is open.  Again this doesn't work on Mac.

To add a submenu, you simply create a new menu by calling `addMenu()` on the parent menu.
You can then add actions to it as normal. For example:

[source,python]
----
include::code/toolbars_and_menus_9.py[]
----


Finally lets add a keyboard shortcut to the `QAction`.
You define a keyboard shortcut by passing setKeySequence() and passing in the key sequence.
Any defined key sequences will appear in the menu.

[TIP]
.Hidden shortcuts
====
Note that the keyboard shortcut is associated
with the `QAction` and will still work whether or not the `QAction` is added to a menu or a toolbar.
====

Key sequences can be defined in multiple ways - either by passing as text, using key names from the
Qt namespace, or using the defined keysequences from the Qt namespace. Use the latter wherever you can
to ensure compliance with the operating system standards.

The completed code, showing the toolbar buttons and menus is shown below.

IMPORTANT: Save a copy of your file as `MyApp_menus.py` as we'll need it again later.

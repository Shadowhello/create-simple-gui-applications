== Dialogs

Dialogs are useful GUI components that allow you to *communicate* with the user (hence
the name dialog). They are commonly used for file Open/Save, settings, preferences,
or for functions that do not fit into the main UI of the application. They are small
modal (or *blocking*) windows that sit in front of the main application until they are
dismissed.  Qt actually provides a number of 'special' dialogs for the most common
use-cases, allowing you to take advantage of desktop-specific tools for a better
user experience.

In Qt dialog boxes are handled by the `QDialog` class. To create a new dialog
box simply create a new object of `QDialog` type (or a subclass), passing in
a parent widget, e.g. `QMainWindow`, as its parent.

Let's create our own `QDialog`, we'll use our menu example code so we can start a dialog
window when a button on the toolbar is pressed.

TIP: Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_menus.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

In the triggered function (that receives the signal from the button )
we create the dialog instance, passing our `QMainWindow` instance as a
parent. This will make the dialog a *modal window* of `QMainWindow`. This means the
dialog will completely block interaction with the parent window.

Once we have created the dialog, we start it using `.exec_()` - just like we did for
`QApplication` to create the main event loop of our application. That’s not a coincidence:
when you exec the `QDialog` an entirely new event loop - specific for the dialog - is created.

[TIP]
.One event loop to rule them all
====
Remember I said there can only be one Qt event loop running at any time?
I meant it! The `QDialog` completely blocks your application execution.
Don't start a dialog and expect anything else to happen anywhere else in your application.

We'll cover how you can use multithreading to get you out of this pickle in a later chapter.

icon:rocket[] *Run it!* The window will display, now click the bug button and a modal
window should appear. You can exit by clicking the [x].
====

Like our very first window, this isn't very interesting. Let's fix that by
adding a dialog title and a set of OK and Cancel buttons to allow the user to *accept*
or *reject* the modal.

To customise the `QDialog` we can subclass it — again you *can* customise the dialog
without subclassing, but it's nicer if you do.

In the above code, we first create our subclass of `QDialog` which we've called `CustomDialog`.
As for the `QMainWindow` we customise it within the `\\__init__` block to ensure that our
customisations are created as the object is created. First we set a title for the `QDialog` using
`.setWindowTitle()`, exactly the same as we did for our main window.

The next block of code is concerned with creating and displaying the dialog buttons. This
is probably a bit more involved than you were expecting. However, this is due to Qt's flexibility
in handling dialog button positioning on different platforms.

[WARNING]
.Easy way out?
====
You could of course choose to ignore this and use a standard `QButton` in a layout, but the approach
outlined here ensures that your dialog respects the host desktop standards
(Ok on left vs. right for example). Messing around with these behaviours
can be incredibly annoying to your users, so I wouldn't recommend it.
====

The first step in creating a dialog button box is to define the buttons want to show,
using  namespace attributes from `QDialogButtonBox`. Constructing a line of multiple buttons is
as simple as ORing them together using a pipe (`|`). The full list of buttons available
is below:


[options="header"]
|===
| Button types
| `QDialogButtonBox.Ok`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Open`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Save`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Cancel`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Close`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Discard`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Apply`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Reset`
| `QDialogButtonBox.RestoreDefaults`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Help`
| `QDialogButtonBox.SaveAll`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Yes`
| `QDialogButtonBox.YesToAll`
| `QDialogButtonBox.No`
| `QDialogButtonBox.NoToAll`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Abort`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Retry`
| `QDialogButtonBox.Ignore`
| `QDialogButtonBox.NoButton`
|===

These should be sufficient to create any dialog box you can think of. For example, to show an
OK and a Cancel button we used:

    buttons = QDialogButtonBox.Ok | QDialogButtonBox.Cancel

The variable `buttons` now contains a bitmask flag representing those two buttons. Next,
we must create the `QDialogButtonBox` instance to hold the buttons. The flag for the
buttons to display is passed in as the first parameter.

To make the buttons have any effect, you must connect the correct
`QDialogButtonBox` signals to the slots on the dialog. In our case we've connected the
`.accepted` and `.rejected` signals from  the `QDialogButtonBox` to the handlers for
`.accept()` and `.reject()` on  our subclass of `QDialog`.

Lastly, to make the `QDialogButtonBox` appear in our dialog box we must add it to the
dialog layout. So, as for the main window we create a layout, and add our `QDialogButtonBox`
to it (`QDialogButtonBox` is a widget), and then set that layout on our dialog.

====
icon:rocket[] *Run it!* Click to launch the dialog and you will see a dialog box with buttons in it.
====

Congratulations! You've created your first dialog box. Of course, you can continue to
add any other content to the dialog box that you like. Simply insert it into the
layout as normal.

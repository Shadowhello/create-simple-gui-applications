= Getting Started

Before you start coding you will first need to have a working installation of 
PyQt and Qt on your system. The following sections will guide you through this
process for the main available platforms. If you already have a working installation
of PyQt on your Python system you can safely skip this part and get straight
onto the fun.


[WARNING]
====
Note that the following instructions are *only* for installation of the *GPL licensed*
version of PyQt. If you need to use PyQt in a non-GPL project you will
need to purchase an alternative license from https://www.riverbankcomputing.com[Riverbank Computing] 
in order to release your software.
====

[TIP]
====
The PyQt packages from Riverbank do not include the Qt documentation. However this
is available online at http://docs.qt.io[docs.qt.io]. If you want to 
download the documentation you can do so from http://www.qt.io[www.qt.io].
====

== Installation Windows

PyQt5 for Windows can be installed as for any other application or library. As of Qt 5.6
installers are available to install via PyPi, the Python Package archive.

== PyQt5 for Python 3

As of writing PyQt 5.10 is available on PyPi. To install PyQt5 from Python3 simply run:

     pip3 install pyqt5

After install is finished, you should be able to run `python` and `import PyQt5`.

Note that if you want access to Qt Creator you will need to download this from https://qt.io/download[the Qt
downloads site]. Download the installer for Qt — you can select to just install Qt Creator during the installation
process.

== PyQt5 for Python 2.7

Unfortunately, if you want to use PyQt5 on Python 2.7 there are no official installers
available to do this. This part of a policy by Riverbank Computing to encourage
transition to Python 3 and reduce their support burden.

However, there is nothing technically stopping PyQt5 being compiled for Python 2.7 and
the helpful group at http://abstractfactory.io[Abstract Factory] have 
http://blog.abstractfactory.io/pyqt5-1-1-for-python-2-7/[done exactly that].

Simply download the above `.rar` file and unpack it with 7zip (or other unzip application).
You can then copy the resulting folder to your Python site-packages folder — usually
in `C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\`.

Once that is done, you should be able to run `python` and `import PyQt5`.

== Installation Mac

OS X comes with a pre-installed version of Python (2.7), however attempting to 
install PyQt5 into this is more trouble than it is worth. If you are planning to 
do a lot of Python development, and you should, it will be easier in the long
run to create a distinct installation of Python separate from the system.

By far the simplest way to do this is to use http://brew.sh/[Homebrew]. Homebrew
is a package manager for command-line software on MacOS X. Helpfully Homebrew also
has a pre-built version of PyQt5 in their repositories.

.Homebrew — the missing package manager for OS X.

To install homebrew run the following from the command line:

[.terminal]
----
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----

TIP: This is also available to copy and paste from the Homebrew homepage.

Once the Homebrew installation has completed, you can then install Python 3 and PyQt5 
as follows:

[.terminal]
----
brew install python3
brew install pyqt5 --with-python-3
----
    
After that has completed, you should be able to run `python3` and `import PyQt5`.

TIP: Alternatively, once you've installed Python 3 you can use `pip3 install pyqt5` to install
from PyPi. There should be no difference between the two.

== Installation Linux (Ubuntu)

Installation on Linux is very straightforward as packages for PyQt5 are available in
the repositories of most distributions. In Ubuntu you can install either from
the command line or via "Software Center". The packages you are looking for are
named `python3-pyqt5` or `python-pyqt5` depending on which version you are installing for.

You can also install these from the command line as follows:

[.terminal]
----
apt-get install python3-pyqt5
----
    
Or for Python 2.7:

[.terminal]
----
apt-get install python-pyqt5
----

Once the installtion is finished, you should be able to run `python3` or `python` and `import PyQt5`.

# Introduction

Welcome to Creating Simple GUI Applications where we’re going to use
Python and Qt to do just that.

I’m Martin Fitzpatrick - a scientific programmer with 8+ years Python
experience and 5 years experience building applications with PyQt.

So why did I make this course?

If you want to learn to build GUI applications with Python the learning
curve can be pretty steep. There seems to be a lot you need to know just
to get something to work.

Many tutorials offer nothing but screencasts and miss the simple
concepts that actually matter. Like writing any code, successfully
writing PyQt GUI applications is all about thinking in the right way.

It’s not difficult to get a GUI application up and running in Python you
just need to know where to start.


In this course I’m going to give you the real useful basics that you
need to get building PyQt applications as quickly as possible.

I’ll include explanations, diagrams, walkthroughs and code to make sure
you know what you’re doing every step of the way.

By the end of the first 8 minute lesson you will have a running Qt
application - ready to customise as you like.

So, lets get started!

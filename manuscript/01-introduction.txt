# Introduction

Welcome to *Creating Simple UI Applications* where we will discover how
to use Python and Qt to do just that.

Unfortunately, if you want to learn how to write GUI applications it
can be pretty tricky to get started. There are a lot of new concepts 
you need to understand to get *anything* to work. Many tutorials offer
nothing but screencasts, or short code snippets without any explanation
of the underlying systems and how they work together. But, like writing any code, 
successfully GUI applications is all about thinking in the right way.

In this book I will give you the real useful basics that you need to get
building functional applications with the PyQt framework.  I’ll include explanations, 
diagrams, walkthroughs and code to make sure you know what you’re doing every step of 
the way. 

In no time at all you will have a fully functional Qt application - 
ready to customise as you like.

So, lets get started!

# Getting Started

Before you start coding you will first need to have a working installation of 
PyQt and Qt on your system. The following sections will guide you through this
process for the main available platforms. If you already have a working installation
of PyQt on your Python system you can safely skip this part and get straight
onto the fun.

## Installation Windows

Download from www.qt.io
You probably want the Community edition
Are you releasing your project under GPL, LGPL license?
Your platform will be automatically detected, and the correct files installed

![The Windows system panel, where you can find out if you're running 64 or 32bit.](images/windows-system-panel.png)

## PyQt for Python 3

Official build from PyQt developer
Riverbank Computing
Download from riverbankcomputing.com
You must select the correct platform yourself — 32 or 64 bit (x32 or x64)

## PyQt5 for Python2.7

Not provided by Riverbank
Available to download from a blog at:
blog.abstractfactory.io/pyqt5-1-1-for-python-2-7/
No installer included — download and unpack (.rar) with 7zip, then copy to your Python site-packages folder


## Installation Mac

You can safely skip this lecture
Note: Some other methods of installation may cause problems when trying to package applications for distribution
If you have a problem, you can already try it this way later!

MacOS X ships with Python pre-installed
But…
It’s often out of date
Installing PyQt5 can be tricky
Can complicate distributing applications
Mess it up and you can break your system

Best installed on Mac via Homebrew
Pre-built, pre-linked and guaranteed to work together
Also installs non-system Python
You can develop without worrying about breaking your system


## Installation Linux


Install with “Software Center” on Ubuntu
You can install for Python3 or 2.7
		python3-pyqt5
		python-pyqt5
This will install Qt5 automatically if not already installed

You can also install from the command line with:

    apt-get install python3-pyqt5

== Getting started with Qt Creator

So far we have been creating apps using Python code. This is fine
for simple applications, but as your applications get larger or interfaces
become more complicated, it can get a bit cumbersome to define all elements
programmatically in this way. The good news is that Qt comes with a graphical editor — 
 Qt Creator — which contains a drag-and-drop UI editor.

In this chapter we'll cover the basics of creating UIs with Qt Creator.
The principles, layouts and widgets are identical, so you can apply
everything you've already learnt. You'll also need your knowledge of
the Python API to hook up your application logical later.

You can download Qt Creator from the Qt website. Just go to the https://qt.io
website and download the Qt package. Don't worry,
you can opt to only install Qt Creator in the installer.

=== Creating a .ui file

Open up Qt Creator and you will be presented with the main window.
The designer is available via the tab on the left hand side. However,
to activate this you first need to start creating a `.ui` file.

To create a `.ui` file go to File -> New File or Project... In the
window that appears select _Qt_ under _Files and Classes_ on the left,
then select _Qt Designer Form_ on the right. You'll notice the icon has
"ui" on it, showing the type of file you're creating.

.Create a new Qt .ui file.

In the next step you'll be asked what type of widget you want to create.
If you are starting an application then _Main Window_ is the right choice.
However, you can also create `.ui` files for dialog boxes, forms and
custom compound widgets.

.Select the type of widget to create, for most applications this will be Main Window.

Next choose a filename and save folder for your file. Save
your `.ui` file with the same name as the class
you'll be creating, just to make make subsequent commands simpler.

.Choose save name and folder your your file.

Finally, you can choose to add the file to your version control system
if you're using one. Feel free
to skip this step — it doesn't affect your UI.

.Optionally add the file to your version control, e.g. Git.

=== Laying out your Main Window

You'll be presented with your newly created main window in the UI
designer. There isn't much to see to begin with, just a grey working
area representing the window, together with the beginnings of a window
menu bar.

You can resize the window by clicking the window and
dragging the blue handles on each corner.

The first step in building an application is to add some widgets to
your window. In our first applications we learnt that to set the
central widget for a `QMainWindow` we need to use `.setCentralWidget()`.
We also saw that to add multiple widgets with a layout, we need an
intermediary `QWidget` to apply the layout to, rather than adding
the layout to the window directly.

Qt Creator takes care of this for you automatically, although it's not
particularly obvious about it.

To add multiple widgets to the main window with a layout, first
drag your widgets onto the `QMainWindow`. Here we're dragging 3
labels. It doesn't matter where you drop them.

.Main window with 1 labels and 1 button added.
image::qt-creator-layout1.png[scaledwidth=50%,align="center"]

We've created 2 widgets by dragging them onto the window, made
them children of that window. We can now apply a layout.

Find the `QMainWindow` in the right hand panel (it should be right at
the top). Underneath you see _centralwidget_ representing the window's
central widget. The icon for the central widget show the current layout
applied. Initially it has a red circle-cross through it, showing that
there is no layout active.

Right click on the `QMainWindow` object, and find 'Layout' in the
resulting dropdown.

.Right click on the main window, and choose layout.

Next you'll see a list of layouts which you can apply to the window.
Select _Lay Out Horizontally_ and the layout will be applied to the
widget.

.Select layout to apply to the main window.

The selected layout is applied to the the _centralwidget_ of the `QMainWindow`
and the widgets are added the layout, being laid out depending on the
selected layout. Note that in Qt Creator you can actually drag and re-order
the widgets within the layout, or select a different layout, as you like.
This makes it especially nice to prototyping and trying out things.

=== Converting your .ui file to Python

We've created a very simple UI. The next step is to get this into
Python and use it to construct an working application.

First save your `.ui` file — by default it will save at the location you chosen
while creating it, although you can choose another location if you like.

The `.ui` file is in XML format. To use our UI in Python we must first
convert it to Python using the `pyuic5` tool.

NOTE: If you're using PyQt4 the tool is named `pyuic4`, but is otherwise
completely identical.

To generate a Python output file run `pyuic5` from the command line,
passing the `.ui` file and the target file for output, with a `-o`
parameter. The following will generate a Python file named `MainWindow.py`
which contains our created UI. I use CamelCase on the filename to
remind myself its a PyQt class file.

    pyuic5 mainwindow.ui -o MainWindow.py

You can open the resulting `MainWindow.py` file in an editor to take a
look, although you should _not_ edit this file. The power of using
Qt Creator is being able to edit, tweak and update your application
while you develop. Any changes made to this file will be lost when you
update it. However, you _can_ override and tweak anything you like
when you import and use the file in your applications.

=== Building your application

Importing the resulting Python file works as for any other.
You can import your class as follows. The `pyuic5` tool appends `Ui_`
to the name of the object defined in _Qt Creator_, and it is this object
you want to import.

    from MainWindow import Ui_MainWindow

To create the main window in your application, create a class as normal
but subclassing from both `QMainWindow` and your imported `Ui_MainWindow`
class. Finally, call `self.setupUi(self)` from within the `__init__`
to trigger the setup of the interface.

    class MainWindow(QMainWindow, Ui_MainWindow):
        def __init__(self, *args, obj=None, **kwargs):
            super(MainWindow, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.setupUi(self)

That's it. Your window is now fully set up.

=== Adding application logic

You can interact with widgets created through Qt Creator just as you
would those created with code. To make things simpler, `pyuic5`
adds all widgets to the window object.

TIP: The name used for objects can be found through Qt Creator. Simply
click on it in the editor window, and then look for objectName in the
properties panel.

In the follow example we use the generated main window class to build
a working application.

Notice that because we haven't set font size and alignment in the
Qt Creator `.ui` definition, we must do so manually with code. You can
change any widget parameters in this way, just as before. However, it
is usually better to configure these things within Qt Creator itself.

You can set any widget properties through the properties panel on the
bottom right of the window. Most widget properties are exposed here,
for example, updating the font size on the `QLabel`:

.Setting the font size for the QLabel.

You can also configure alignment. For compound properties (where you
can set multiple values, such as left + middle) they are nested.

=== Explore

This introduction has only scratched the surface of what Qt Creator is
capable of. I highly recommend you dig a little deeper and experiment
— remember you can still add or adjust widgets from code afterwards.
